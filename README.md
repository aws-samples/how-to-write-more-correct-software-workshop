Welcome to the How To Write More Correct Software workshop!
This workshop will help you learn how to use two powerful tools
to make more of your code more correct:

1. [Dafny](dafny.org), a programming language that formally verifies your implementation matches your specification
2. [Duvet](https://github.com/awslabs/duvet), a code quality tool for measuring how well your human-readable specification is covered in code
