# How To Write More Correct Software

Welcome to the How To Write More Correct Software workshop!

We're here to help you learn how to use two powerful tools
to make more of your code more correct:

1. [Dafny](dafny.org), a programming language that formally verifies your implementation matches your specification
2. [Duvet](https://github.com/awslabs/duvet), a code quality tool for measuring how well your human-readable specification is covered in code

This content is currently a work in progress - use at your own risk, mind our dust, and stay tuned!
